## Bhutan Football Federation App

### About this project
The Bhutan Football mobile app, built for the Bhutan Football Federation, offers real-time updates on live scores, match schedules, ground booking, team standings, and advertisements. It features an admin-only mobile interface for updating data, ensuring streamlined and up-to-date information. Developed and delivered entirely for free by our dedicated team, the app serves as a valuable resource for Bhutanese football fans and the Federation alike.

I served as a team leader for the project.
